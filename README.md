# Module 15 Challenge
This repository contains my FinTech Bootcamp Module 15 Challenge Code
<h1>Background</h1>
<li>I've been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They would like to increase their client portfolio - especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I decde to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.</li>
<h2>What I am Creating</h2>
<li>In this challenge, I will combine AWS skills with existing Python knowledge to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.</li>
<li>I will be asked to accomplish the following tasks:</li>
<li>1). Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.</li>
<li>2). Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that my bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.</li>
<li>3). Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.</li>
<h3>Packages & Technologies Used</h3>
